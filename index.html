        <div> Ellie in Lexington: <i>"Ladir has cleaned my home weekly for over two decades!
              She is trustworthy, conscientious, thorough, and always pleasant! She is very flexible about focusing on
              different areas or cleaning jobs within the house, depending on what I need on a given week."</i></div>
        <div> Dave in Rockland: <i>"Ladir is a very hard working house cleaner.  When she was contracted by my late wife,
              both of us were not in good shape.  She was fighting cancer and I was recovering from surgery!
              So Ladir cleaned our house every other week and it was done very thoroughly.  When my wife passed, I kept Ladir
              on for the bi-weekly cleaning."</i></div>
